# Vera Assistant Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that integrates with your Vera AI assistant to fill form fields intelligently, eliminating the copy-paste workflow.

## Features

- **Smart Field Selection**: Click on any text input, textarea, or contenteditable element
- **Context-Aware**: Automatically includes current field values as context
- **Direct Integration**: Communicates directly with your local Vera instance
- **Seamless Workflow**: Generate and insert text without leaving your browser

## Prerequisites

1. Vera must be running locally (default: `http://localhost:8000`)
2. Chrome or Chromium-based browser (Edge, Brave, etc.)

## Installation

### 1. Start Vera

Make sure Vera is running:

```bash
cd /path/to/Vera
source venv/bin/activate
python vera.py
```

### 2. Load Extension in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right corner)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `vera-extension` folder
5. The Vera Assistant icon should appear in your extensions toolbar

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Navigate to any webpage** with a form or text field
2. **Click the Vera Assistant icon** in your Chrome toolbar
3. **Click "Select Field on Page"** button
4. **Click on the input field** you want to fill (it will highlight on hover)
5. **Enter your prompt** describing what you want Vera to write
6. **Click "Send to Vera"** and wait for the response
7. **Click "Insert into Field"** to fill the selected field

### Example Use Cases

#### Email Drafting
- Select the email body field
- Prompt: "Draft a professional follow-up email after yesterday's meeting"
- Insert the generated response

#### Form Filling
- Select a description field
- Prompt: "Write a brief professional bio for a software engineer"
- Insert the generated text

#### Content Creation
- Select a comment or post field
- Prompt: "Write a thoughtful comment about this article, focusing on the AI implications"
- Insert the generated comment

## Settings

Click the ⚙️ icon to configure:

- **Vera Endpoint**: Change if Vera is running on a different port (default: `http://localhost:8000`)

## How It Works

1. **Content Script** (`content.js`): Runs on all web pages, detects and highlights input fields
2. **Popup UI** (`popup.html/js`): Provides the interface for interacting with Vera
3. **Background Service** (`background.js`): Manages extension lifecycle and settings
4. **Vera API**: Extension sends requests to `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint

## Troubleshooting

### "Content script not loaded" error
- **Solution**: Refresh the webpage and try again. The extension needs to initialize on the page.

### "Error calling Vera" message
- **Check**: Is Vera running? Try accessing `http://localhost:8000/health` in your browser
- **Check**: Is the correct endpoint configured in extension settings?
- **Check**: Are you using the correct port? (default is 8000)

### Field won't highlight
- **Try**: Refreshing the page
- **Note**: Some fields may be protected or use custom implementations that aren't detected

### Text not inserting
- **Try**: Clicking the field manually first, then using the extension
- **Note**: Some sites use complex form frameworks that may interfere

## Privacy & Security

- All data stays local - communication is only between your browser and local Vera instance
- No external servers or third-party services are contacted
- The extension requires minimal permissions (activeTab, storage)
